The proliferation of web-apps has made it easier than ever to access high quality services. No need for installations, updates, or downloads. But at the same time, we've seen our browsers balloon with tabs. While working in a Google doc, we get distracted by an email on Gmail, or even worse, a notification from your social media of choice. 

In his book, <i>[Hyperfocus](https://alifeofproductivity.com/hyperfocus/)</i>, Chris Bailey writes about how one can re-gain their focus in a digital world and get more work done better. To explain how one can reach this level of "hyperfocus," Bailey introduces the concept of attentional space. Attentional space is limited. There are only so many things we can pay attention to at once. Multi-tasking only works when we are working on a group of relatively small, routine tasks. Not for complex problems like writing a report.

The more of our attentional space that is filled with a certain task, the larger our ability to focus on it and get it done well. 

Working in the browser can be frustrating because it often provides the opposite of whats needed to protect attentional space. One unfinished graphic on Canva draws our attention when we never finished tabulating our data in Google Sheets. When you realize you need to reference an article, you discover that you closed the tab which housed it ten minutes ago and spend the next five minutes trying to find it again.

All this jumping between contexts and tabs limits our ability to complete good work in good time. So what can we do? 

Bailey suggests we be intentional with our time. When we sit down to work, we should have in mind what we want to spend this time working on. Then cut out everything that is not relevant and catch ourselves when our minds do inevitably wander. 

It's challenging but can return great benefits to our focus, work, and wellbeing.

<i> If you'd like some help in limiting distractions and creating effective workspaces in the browser, we invite you to [add Stew to your browser](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stew-tab-and-workspace-ma/mpgembgbcmglafhihbhendibhekajjep). It allows you to save tab and window configurations for work. Enable 'Clean workspace' and when you launch a configuration Stew will remove all the tabs and windows that aren't relevant, setting you up for a successful work period. </i>
